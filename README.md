An open source audio player/manager application for windows 10 and above based on the javascript framework electron.

## Motivation behind it

Around April of 2023 I was working on a project for a Hackathon which was about distributing audio books to a larger audience, for the said reason I started to collect/record a bunch of different audio files and noticed how annoying it is to access/organize them. The windows recorder app and many several other applications which I found online didn't help much either, with old school organizing, options and corporate esk themes these apps didn't fit well with my needs, thus I decided to make my own app which solves all these sort of "niche" problems of mine, well.. kind of.. for now atleast.
